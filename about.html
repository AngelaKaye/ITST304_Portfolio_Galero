		<h1> About Me </h1>
		<p> Hi! My Name is Angela Kaye A. Galero, and I was born on May 25, 2002. I was named by a midwife who assisted my mother in giving birth to me and my twin. Yes, I have a twin sister, but she died soon after she was born in my mother's womb. My family and I were now residing in Rizal, Laguna. My father baptized me and my two brothers in a Christian church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, in 2012. My mother, on the other hand, was baptized as a Roman Catholic. </p>
