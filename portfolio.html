		<p> During high school, I learned how to do calligraphy and I was to acquire this skill. I use it in making journals and projects. Also, I discovered my acting abilities in high school. Meanwhile, I became interested in vector arts throughout the pandemic. I was inspired by some artists on Facebook and Tiktok. However, I am not really good at it and I would like to improve. In terms of design making, I prefer being minimalist. I am not really a talented person. But, there are other things I'd like to learn, such ass painting, crocheting, and playing piano. </p>
