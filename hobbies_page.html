		<p> Most of the time, I prefer watching anime movies over anime series. Slice of life, adventure, fantasy, and drama are among my favorite genres. I love watching Ghibli films, particularly Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away. </p>

		<p> During high school, I learned how to do calligraphy and I was able to acquire this skill. I use it in making journals and projects. Also, I discovered my acting abilities in high school. Meanwhile, I became interested in vector arts throughout the pandemic. I was inspired by some artists on Facebook and Tiktok. However, I am not really good at it and I would like to improve. In terms of design making, I prefer being a minimalist. I am not really a talented person. But there are other things I'd like to learn, such as painting, crocheting, and piano. </p>

		<p> Regarding music, my preference is towards folk music. Usually, I enjoy listening to song covers of Renee Dominque and tracks from TWICE, my favorite K-pop girl group. However, what I truly cherish is listening to youth songs from our church. </p>
